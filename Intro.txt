Hello

My name is Rahul Saini. I am from Jaipur. I am doing my b.tech from NIT Delhi and the graduation year is 2023.

So in this Assignment I have learned about the github Desktop Feature. So I did learn about the what is github? 
and why we use github? and how we can create the repositories in github?
I did also learn about the cloning, pushing, pulling and commiting the code.

Basically the github is a remote Server which is used to store the code and also it can be used as a version control.
There are some terms and features that we can use, these are:

Repositories:  These are as same as of folder but in terms of git feature it is known as repositories. To create the repo 
first we click on new repo and then after entering repo name, public access and add readme file we can create this repo.
now to add files in this just go to add files and select option to upload files and upload all your files. In this way you can create 
the repo.

Cloning/Downloading Zip File:
creating a copy of the repo to your local storage is known as clonning. to do that click on code and click on the download zip option
at the bottom. Now you can unzip that file and see that it is on your local system.

pushing:
In this method we will update the changes to the files present in the repo by the same way by uploading the files.

pulling:
this is done when we want to merge a branch into master branch.

commit:  this is the option or changes information through which we update the code or upload the new files.

branch:  In the github there is one more option of version control that is branches through which we can work parallely.
